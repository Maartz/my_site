Hi, I'm William, welcome to my website.
I'm currently working as a software developer @Thales.
Working on medical devices and industrial production.

Coming from Java and Javascript, I'm diving into the functional programming world.
I talk about languages like Elixir, Ruby, Javascript and maybe others.

Feel free to reach me : maartz at protonmail dot com
