Well, well, well...

It's been a long time ago I've didn't make a website.
At first it was my entry point in the industry !

Learning to be a HTML Developer -- true.
CSS and stuff, JS, etc.

I've even have a degree in UX.
But, making this site is kinda different.

First of all, I don't really care if it's fancy or not. I just want it to work.
Sit in front of Vim -- cool kid obviously -- and write a .md page to update my site.

---
In fact I just want simplicity
---

Well that what I was expecting, and it's what I've got.

Not disappointed, everything is familiar.

I do not think that Serum is at the same level of big players like Gatsby, Gridsome, Hexo or even Hugo.
But it fit my needs so, to good to go !
