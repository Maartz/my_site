## A bit of background

Months ago, I decided to dive deep into the functional programming world.

I got my toes wet with JavaScript. It was really hard to grok the little plus behind FP. Since JS is not functional.

I was trying to stay in my comfort zone. Keep my computer science background and knowledge. For loop, switch, classes, etc.

**It was a bad idea**

I've had to accept that I must forget absolutely -- almost -- everything I've learned and come with a free, empty, fresh mind.
That was harder than I thought. After 3 years of Java and Javascript all day long. Avoid encapsulation and stuff is not easy.

Back in 2014, I've begun my journey in software development with a very cool language. **Ruby**.

It has various pros and cons to use Ruby. To be honest I do not care if it's fast or not. I like its expressiveness. Computers can be faster and faster. Write code fast is an easy task with Ruby.

Anyway, I've heard that concurrency will be the next *BIG STUFF* because of realtime apps.

I've tried [Golang](https://golang.org), its simplicity was a breeze. But all those interfaces and duck-typing annoyed me a lot. I just not fit my expectations. Maybe I'll give it another try later.

Then I've heard of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Created by JosÃ© Valim, who is a former software engineer at Plataformatec and a core Rails developer. It's based on the Erlang language and runs on top of the BEAM virtual machine. And at first, it looks really like Ruby. But it's not Ruby. It's another paradigm, it's functional.

## So grok or not?

I can't say that I'm groking FP, but, after hours of practice. On Exercism, Codewars and stuff. I appreciate how we can build a reusable code in Elixir.

The map example is great to show the difference between JS and Elixir

Take this array `[1,2,3,4,5]`, and multiply every item by itself.

### Javascript

```javascript
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
array.map(elem => elem * elem)
```

### Elixir

```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Enum.map list, &(&1 * &1)
```

I've used shorthand syntax for both of the languages.
For the sake of explanation, I'm gonna rewrite them in plain text.

### Javascript

```javascript
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Gonna use ES5, sorry ES6 police ðŸš¨
array.map(function(element) {
    return element * element;
});
```

### Elixir

```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Enum.map(list, fn item -> item * item end)
```

Elixir relies on Modules, they are kinda like namespaces or bucket for functions. Elixir has a great standard library, and it's interoperable with Erlang libraries, e.g: Elixir has no MD5 hash function, but Erlang does.

```elixir
my_string_to_be_hashed = "Elixir is great"
hash = :crypto.hash(:md5, my_string_to_be_hashed)
```

And that's pretty much it.
We can see a pattern, every time we need to use data, we need to pass it to the function. And that's a very big thing to understand.

Ciao!
