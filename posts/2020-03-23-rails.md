I'm following tuts about Ruby On Rails in 2020.
It's pretty interesting to watch how we can leverage Ruby On Rails 🧙‍♂️*MAGIC* 🧙‍♂️ framework to build stuff quickly.

![I said quickly](https://media.giphy.com/media/Np57GYvAYga5y/giphy.gif)


Rails is not a newcomer in the industry, so I'm not gonna present it. Anyway, it's a framework built by guys from Basecamp, precisely, David Heinemeier Hansson aka DHH.

I've built some applications, some SPAs. With the help of React, Redux, Redux-Thunk and Firebase. It was a good experience. But I disliked this. It was hard, for no reason. In my humble opinion. Single-page apps built with modern front-end frameworks/libraries are a bad idea in 90% of the case.

Too much complexity for the sake of what? Speed? User experience? Fancy UI library? Well. [Turbolinks](https://dev.to/jerodsanto/why-we-chose-turbolinks-instead-of-building-an-spa-21o0) is a great technology, and we should leverage it as Rails does, moreover as Rails give us the ability to use it with ease.

[This podcast](https://corecursive.com/david-heinemeier-hansson-software-contrarian-transcript/) gave me also a good opinion on the actual software industry.

So I share DHH opinion :

> The crimes against programming humanities that have been done in the service of single-page applications are far worse than the ones that have been done in the service of microservices.
> But then of course, as it is, lots of people combine the two. So it’s a fleet of microservices serving a single page application, and that’s just where it bam, my head explodes with like, yeah, I would rather retire and fucking, I don’t know, make weaved baskets than deal with that shit.

Make spaghetti code on micro-services rather than on a monolith does not make it faster or better. It just makes it more complex and a pain to work with.

So...Yeah, I'm following tuts on Rails in 2020, and it makes sense.
